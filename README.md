# Overview of This Analysis

The purpose of this project was to use JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, to create 3 charts; a bar, bubble and gauge chart. The charts display the following when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage, the top 10 bacterial species, and a measure from 0-10 for the weekly washing frequency value on the progress bar.

This project also called for knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap to customize the webpage dashboard.
